|File name|Description|
|---|---|
|[**0-preprocessor**](https://github.com/GM-Samuelstein/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)|*This Shell Script runs a C file that is saved in the variable named `$CFILE` through the preprocessor, and saves the result into another file named `c`.*|
|[**1-compiler**](https://github.com/GM-Samuelstein/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)|*This Shell Script compiles a C file that is saved in the variable named `$CFILE`, but does not link. The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.*|
|[**2-assembler**](https://github.com/GM-Samuelstein/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)|*This Shell Script generates the assembly code of a C file that is saved in the variable named `$CFILE`. The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.*|
|[**3-name**](https://github.com/GM-Samuelstein/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name)|*This Shell Script compiles a C file that is saved in the variable named `$CFILE`, and saves the output in an executable file named `cisfun`.*|
|[**4-puts.c**](https://github.com/GM-Samuelstein/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)|*This C file is a program that prints exactly `"programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line, using the `puts` function, and not the `printf` function. The program ends with a return value of `0`.*|
|[**5-printf.c**](https://github.com/GM-Samuelstein/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)|*This C file is a program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line, using the `printf` function, and not the `puts` function. The program ends with a return value of `0`.*|
|[**6-size.c**](https://github.com/GM-Samuelstein/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)|*This C file is a program that prints the size of various data types, on the computer it is compiled and run on. The program ends with a return value of `0`.*|
