def island_perimeter(grid):

    A function that returns the perimiter of an island described by the
    parameter "grid".

    Args:
        grid (list): A list of list of integers representing an island.
            0 represents a water zone.
            1 represents a land zone.
            One cell is a square with side length 1.
            Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically
            (not diagonally).
            Grid is rectangular, width and height donâ€™t exceed 100.

    Returns:
        The perimeter of the island defined in grid.
